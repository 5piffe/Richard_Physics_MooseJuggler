Game?
    - Pool?
        Just plain old pool-table style
    
    - Minigolf
        Simple minigolf game
    
    - Space program game? <- This idea for now. Just keep it simple...
        Launch rocket, Use different gravity simulations.
        More like a sandbox.
        Have the engines power working against the gravitational force
        using a custom addForce method.

        [More ideas for Space program game thing]
        Add this only after you have;
            * Rocket launching
            * Separate force for gravity & engine power to work "against" each other
            * Drag (like air resistance)
            * "Burn-time" or fuel (basically for how long you apply engine force after launch)

        - Parachute that pops out when velocity.y goes from + to - (when starting to fall down)
        - Parachute "size" affects fallspeed (drag shit, maybe this is too complicated)

        - Have vector3.up towards the center of something. and calculate gravity towards that instead
            of just falling down. Then you could have a huge sphere as "planet" and just keep it
            infinit gravity-field around it.
        
        !! New plan: Spaceship isn't a launch it's your vehicle.
            You hold space to boost and control angle with the mouse. There's only
            a cirtain amount of fuel so you have to "tap-boost" and be restrictive
            to make it through the level. Maybe there's pickups like fuel boosts on
            the way. And some dangerouse shit.

            Instantiate squirrel gib but with ship-parts (cubes or so) when hitting ground.
            Use bouyancy physics if landing in "water" !!

        - Hoovering spheres in the air. When you collide you "shoot" the sphere
            rocket legue style. And it's lifetime-counter goes down.
            when it's lifetime is over it explodes, giving you fuel
            and instantiates smaller spheres which have gravity on.
            they fall to the ground and bounce a little. -lifetime 


What's up?
    Base:
    [V] Edge detection of plane
            [V]: Semi-fixed. Need to test some more shit.
    [X] Static ie. shouldn't bounce no more. Fix so it doesn't go thru gound.
    [ ] Drag / Air resistance
    [V] Ball react to plane(s) instead of the other way around
        to be able to build ship-cube of planes so we can push ball.
            [V]: Semi-fixed. Need to test when edge detection works.
    
    Other:
    [X] Fuel (timer for how long you can boost).
    [ ] Simple UI for displaying fuel && survivaltime(score).
        Maybe add other pickups for score multiplyers or something.
    [X] Explosion (instantiate smaller spheres that are bouncing and then "smokepuffing away")
    [ ] Explode on ground impact if (velocity is too high || fuel = empty)
    [X] Hoovering spheres that fall to ground (lose their hoover ability and gravity pulls them)
        and explode if you hit them. Hitting them will refuel your ship.
    [ ] Some kind of danger or way to make it harder the longer you survive.


    - Fuck this.... SnowPlowJugglerGame.
        snowplow gliding on icy surface back & forth.
        tilt plow with mouse. left/right with A/D.
        bounce snowball for as many times you can.

        plow will rotate back & forth with increased speed & angle for each bounce.

        drop ball = game over.

        :( 

    
    [ ] Clamp mouse tilt for elk
    [ ] Limit sides of playzone so you stop if you are max left/right
    [ ] Increase tilt-speed & angle for plow for each score
    [ ] 1 PowerUp like "double score for x seconds"
    [ ] Restart if dead
    [V] Score & HighScore
        V: Score is  fixed but need to NOT bring score when ball on ground.
            Highscore is not fixed.
